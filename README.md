# Attendance-Management-System-Using-Face-Recognitions

Built a web-based system to automate attendance using real-time face recognition. Used Django for backend, Python, OpenCV and face recognition for detecting and verifying faces, and designed a responsive frontend using HTML and CSS for easy interaction and record tracking.

This project presents an attendance management system 
using facial recognition technology to automate and 
enhance accuracy in attendance tracking. By leveraging 
real-time image processing and facial recognition 
algorithms, the system captures and verifies student 
identities as they enter the classroom, seamlessly recording 
their attendance. This approach eliminates the inefficiencies 
and inaccuracies of traditional methods, providing a secure 
and reliable solution for educational institutions. By 
recognizing these faces, the system automatically records 
attendance, eliminating the need for manual entry. This 
basic approach to attendance tracking helps save time, 
ensures accuracy, and prevents misuse, such as marking 
attendance for absent students. The system is designed to 
be easy to use and implement in small settings like 
classrooms or offices.
